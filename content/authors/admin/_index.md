I am currently a Senior Associate Research Scientist in the <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-research/" target="_blank">Global Technology Applied Research</a> AR/VR team at JPMorganChase. My research focuses on the human-centred aspects of virtual and augmented reality, with a particular focus on <i>Immersive Analytics</i>. My work has been published in several top-tier peer-reviewed venues, including ACM CHI, IEEE VIS, and IEEE ISMAR. I have also received three Best Paper Honourable Mention Awards from VIS 2021, ISS 2021, and CHI 2022.

Before this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">VISUS, University of Stuttgart</a> where I worked with <a href="https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Schmalstieg/" target="_blank">Dieter Schmalstieg</a> and <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/michael_sedlmair.html" target="_blank">Michael Sedlmair</a>.

I received my PhD at the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/embodied-visualisation" target="_blank">Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab (now Embodied Visualisation Lab)</a> at Monash University. My advisors were <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/" target="_blank">Tim Dwyer</a>, <a href="https://berniejenny.info/" target="_blank">Bernhard Jenny</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cordeil/home" target="_blank">Maxime Cordeil</a>, and <a href="https://www.aprouzeau.com/" target="_blank">Arnaud Prouzeau</a>.
