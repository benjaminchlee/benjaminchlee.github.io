I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.visus.uni-stuttgart.de/en/" target="_blank">VISUS, University of Stuttgart</a>. I work with <a href="https://www.vis.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/team/Schmalstieg/" target="_blank">Dieter Schmalstieg</a> and <a href="https://visvar.github.io/members/michael_sedlmair.html" target="_blank">Michael Sedlmair</a> on <i>Immersive Analytics</i> and <i>Situated Analytics</i>.

Immersive analytics is the use of immersive technologies, including virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), to support data exploration, interaction, and presentation. On the other hand, situated analytics is the display of information close to its physical context to support in-situ analysis and decision-making, nowadays facilitated through the use of AR.

My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, information visualisation, and VR/AR. I have published papers in several top-tier peer-reviewed venues, including ACM CHI, IEEE VIS, and IEEE ISMAR. I have also received three Best Paper Honourable Mention Awards from VIS 2021, ISS 2021, and CHI 2022.

I received my PhD at the <a href="https://www.monash.edu/it/hcc/embodied-visualisation" target="_blank">Data Visualisation and Immersive Analytics Lab (now Embodied Visualisation Lab)</a> at Monash University in 2023. My advisors were <a href="https://ialab.it.monash.edu/~dwyer/" target="_blank">Tim Dwyer</a>, <a href="https://berniejenny.info/" target="_blank">Bernhard Jenny</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cordeil/home" target="_blank">Maxime Cordeil</a>, and <a href="https://www.aprouzeau.com/" target="_blank">Arnaud Prouzeau</a>.
